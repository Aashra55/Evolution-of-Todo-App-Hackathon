  The implementation plan for the CLI Todo App has been created and the research phase (Phase 0) is complete.
phr_outcome: |-
  The implementation plan (plan.md) for the "command-line todo application that stores tasks in memory" was successfully generated. It includes a summary, technical context, constitution check, and project structure. The research phase (Phase 0) was completed with research.md stating no specific research was needed.
phr_evaluation: |-
  The task was completed successfully by generating the plan.md file, filling all relevant sections based on the spec and constitution, and creating an empty research.md (as no clarifications were needed). All constitution checks passed. The plan is now ready for subsequent design phases.
