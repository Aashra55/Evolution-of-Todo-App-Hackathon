# Research for Todo AI Chatbot (Phase III – Basic Level)

**Date**: 2026-02-07

## Summary

Initial review of the Technical Context in `plan.md` indicates no immediate "NEEDS CLARIFICATION" items requiring in-depth research at this stage. All core technologies and architectural decisions are either mandated by the Project Constitution or clearly defined in the Feature Specification.

## Research Findings

*   **No "NEEDS CLARIFICATION" identified in Technical Context**: All items like Language/Version, Primary Dependencies, Storage, etc., are covered by the Project Constitution's mandatory technology stack and the Feature Specification's detailed requirements.
*   **Best Practices for Python FastAPI, OpenAI Agents SDK, SQLModel**: Standard best practices for these technologies will be followed during implementation. No specific research items flagged at this time.
*   **Integration Patterns**: Interactions between Frontend (OpenAI ChatKit), Backend (FastAPI), AI Agent (OpenAI Agents SDK), and MCP Server (Official MCP SDK) will follow standard API integration patterns (e.g., RESTful calls for backend, tool invocation for MCP).

## Decisions

No specific architectural or technical decisions requiring dedicated research were identified as pending or unclear after reviewing the `spec.md` and `constitution.md`.

## Alternatives Considered

Not applicable at this stage, as all major choices are pre-defined by the Project Constitution.
