# Specification Quality Checklist: Todo AI Chatbot (Phase III – Basic Level)

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-02-07
**Feature**: ../spec.md

**Note**: This checklist is generated by the `/sp.checklist` command based on feature context and requirements.

## Content Quality

- [ ] CHK001 No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [ ] CHK002 Focused on user value and business needs
- [ ] CHK003 Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [ ] CHK004 All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [ ] CHK005 No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [ ] CHK006 Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [ ] CHK007 Success criteria are measurable
- [ ] CHK008 Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [ ] CHK009 All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [ ] CHK010 Edge cases are identified
- [ ] CHK011 Scope is clearly bounded
- [ ] CHK012 Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [ ] CHK013 All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [ ] CHK014 User scenarios cover primary flows
- [ ] CHK015 Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [ ] CHK016 No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Check items off as completed: `[x]`
- Add comments or findings inline
- Link to relevant resources or documentation
- Items are numbered sequentially for easy reference

## UI/UX Specification Quality

- [ ] CHK017 UI intent is clearly defined (modern, sleek, professional).
- [ ] CHK018 UX principles (clean, minimal, consistent spacing, intuitive) are clearly specified.
- [ ] CHK019 Layout and structure constraints (chat/todo separation, no overlap, sufficient spacing) are well-defined.
- [ ] CHK020 Component behavior rules (clear affordances, no touching edges, consistent repeated elements) are explicit.
- [ ] CHK021 Visual constraints (no decorative elements, theme adherence, UI density) are documented.
- [ ] CHK022 Error, empty, and loading states are clearly defined for UI presentation.
- [ ] CHK023 UI Acceptance Alignment criteria (evaluable for quality, poor spacing/misalignment are violations) are stated.
