It's concerning that the `ModuleNotFoundError` persists even after updating `sqlmodel`. This usually means the `sqlmodel.relationships` module is genuinely not found.

To help diagnose this, please confirm the exact version of `sqlmodel` currently installed in your poetry environment.

In your `backend` directory, please run the following command and provide its output:
```bash
poetry show sqlmodel
```

This will tell us if `sqlmodel` was updated correctly. Also, please ensure you've performed all the previous steps, especially reinstalling dependencies (`poetry install`) and clearing `__pycache__` directories.
